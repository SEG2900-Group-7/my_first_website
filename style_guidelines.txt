Reviews:


* Thought about having it at the bottom of the product features page, but there might be a better place for it somewhere else (currently omitted from the website but may come back)


NOTE: As of October 24th, 2021 the home page is not responsive on Google Chrome (the image is shortened), but works properly on Safari. This is currently being investigated.
